<li>
<br/><br/> My life closed twice before its close;
<br/> It yet remains to see
<br/>If Immortality unveil
<br/> A third event to me,
<br/>So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
<br/> As these that twice befell.
<br/> Parting is all we know of heaven,
<br/> And all we need of hell.<br/></li>
<li>
<br/><br/>"Hope" is the thing with feathers<br/>
That perches in the soul<br/>
And sings the tune without the words<br/>
And never stops at all.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<br/><br/>The brain is wider than the sky,
<br/>For, put them side by side,
<br/>The one the other will contain
<br/>With ease, and you beside.

<li>
Little Miss Muffett sits on her tuffet
<br/> In a nonchalant sort of a way.
<br/> With her force field around her,
<br/> The spider, the bounder, Is not in the picture today.
</li>
<li>
In a half bright sky
<br/>An insect wraps and winds
<br/>A chain, a thread, a cable
<br/>Around the sphere of water.
</li>
<li>
Radi was a circus lion.
<br/>Radi was a woman hater.
<br/>Radi had a lady trainer.
<br/>Radiator.
</li>
<li>
Order in the court
<br/>The judge is eating beans
<br/>His wife is in the bath-tub
<br/>Counting submarines.
</li>
<li>
On Nevski Bridge a Russian stood
<br/>Chewing his beard for lack of food.
<br/>He said, "It's tough this stuff to eat
<br/>But a darn sight better than shredded wheat."
</li>
<li>
"Hope" is the thing with feathers
<br/>That perches in the soul
<br/>And sings the tune without the words
<br/>And never stops at all.
</li>
<li>
The greedy man is he who sits
<br/>And bites bits out of plates,
<br/>Or else takes up the almanac
<br/>And gobbles all the dates.
</li>
<li>
I  went to the pictures tommorrow
<br/>I took a front seat at the back,
<br/>I fell from the pit to the gallery
<br/>And broke a front bone in my back.
<br/>A lady she gave me some chocolate,
<br/>I ate it and gave it her back.
<br/>I phoned for a taxi and walked it,
<br/>And that's why I never came back.
</li>
<li>
Billy is blowing his trumpet;
<br/>Bertie is banging a tin;
<br/>Betty is crying for Mummy
<br/>And Bob has pricked Ben with a pin.
<br/>Baby is crying out loudly;
<br/>He's out on the lawn in his pram.
<br/>I am the only one silent
<br/>And I've eaten all of the jam.
</li>
<li>
One fine day in the middle of the night
<br/>Two dead men got up to fight
<br/>Back to back they faced each other,
<br/>Drew their swords and shot each other.
</li>
<li>
I smell, yet I am told, that I do not perceive 
<br/>I remember, yet I am told, that I do not ponder 
<br/>I injure, yet I am told, that I do not heal 
<br/>I consume, yet I am told, that I do not hunger 
</li>
<li>
The joke you just told isn't funny one bit,
<br/>It's pointless and dull, wholly lacking in wit.
<br/>It's old and stale, it's beginning to smell!
<br/>Besides, it's the one I was going to tell.
</li>
<li>
The brain is wider than the sky,
<br/>For, put them side by side,
<br/>The one the other will contain
<br/>With ease, and you beside.
</li>
